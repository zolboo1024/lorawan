# LoRaWAN Security #

There have been many discussion recently concerning the security of LoraWAN with the publication of articles such as this, this, and that. These articles point to the fact that LoraWAN, the most widely used network module for IoT is not sufficiently secure and that there needs to be further improvements. The academic community needs to be involved in the improvement of such an integral network design. However, the lack of a LoraWAN simulator software with security features makes it difficult for those who want to research various security techniques and contribute to the field, but do not have the necessary resources to afford the physical devices. I attempted to fix this issue.
The purpose of this project is to add security features (specified by the official guideline, see https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/lorawantm_specification_-v1.1.pdf) to the LoraWAN module so that various security measures can be tested using the module and the implications of such measurements (latency, network delay, packet loss, etc.) be quantified. However, by the nature of simulation, it is not advised to equate the simulator to an actual device in terms of security as there are more ways to break into the actual device. In particular, the project is meant to add the following:

1. Add identification features on the device side, including DevEUI, NwKey, AppKey, and DevNonce (which is reflected in the class secure-end-device-lorawan-mac).
2. Add identification features on the server side, including Join EUI, JoinNonce (which is reflected in the class secure-network-server).
3. Implement the Over-The-Air-Authentication (OTAA) as its join feature (reflected on the end-device classes and the server classes).
4. Implement the encryption and decryption of data using AES-128 Standard (relfected on the packet management classes). 

Since there should be an option to run the simulator without security features (so that the security features can be tested against it), I added “secure” components to the module; I did not update existing ones. The ones I added start with “secure”, such as “secure-end-device-lorawan-mac.cc”, and they implement the security features as outlined by the specifications.
